# Git Convention

## Working with `git` and `GitHub`

#### 1. In any commit in `main` project must be working and at least compilable

#### 2. Features and fixes should be integrated in `main` via pull requests as fast as possible

#### 3. New branches should be started from branch they will be merged into. Pull requests should only be open from branch that was started from `main`

#### 4. Remote repo commit history shold be never changed

#### 5. Commit should be as small as possible (within a reasonable). Its better to have a lot of commits than a giant one

#### 6. `.gitignore` should only contain project-specific files. All paltform and ide-specific files should be added to global gitignore

## Naming

### General

#### 1. Only English is allowed

#### 2. Use meaningful names everywhere

#### 3. Do not transliteration. Exception: proper names

#### 4. Do not use caps

### Commit message

#### 1. First line is a subject line. It should have size about 50 characters, maximum limit is 80. Subject should start with capital letter and has no period or any punctuation at the end

#### 2. Subject line should be a continuation of "This commit will ..."

#### 3. A blank line separates subject from body

#### 4. Detailed description of the change (which may be ommited) should be in the body, breaking paragraphs where needed. The body should explain what you did and why vs. how. The body also starts with a capitalized letter
